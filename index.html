      <p>From Yale classrooms to emergency rooms to coding bootcamps, I’ve flourished in diverse environments thanks to relentless curiosity and empathy for clients or coworkers.</p>
      <p>I pick things up pretty fast—whether new language syntax, healthcare policy, or board game rules—by always asking why they were designed that way, and always share what I've learned.</p>
      <p>I value communication between teammates as much as communication between servers, always keeping an eye on both the technical and the social scopes of my work.</p>
