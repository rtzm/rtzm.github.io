title = "The who/what/why"
+++

My name is Simon, and I'm a software developer in Chicago. I'm an enthusiastic guy who writes code (these days, mostly JS/React and PHP, and some Java) and works on a team as an individual contributor.

Why start a blog? Partially to get myself back into more writing, and maybe more motivated reading. Partially to re-enchant the tedium of a day job with curiosity, self-mesmerization, etc and whatnot. Partially and most immediately thanks to inspiration from [a podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fYKYakP_f0).

What kind of topics will I try to extract from my day?

If my writing is a medium for developing some renewed curiosity, I may look at some specific techical processes, patterns or tools and try to [defamiliarize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamiliarization) them. For example, I've long thought that reading and writing code comes along with a literary theory like reading and writing a natural language. Maybe I'll make some attempts at understanding what that thought means to me.

I'd also like to focus some thought on the spot where a technical problem meets social dynamics and organization: How do problems and solutions translate into and out of code throughout the work day? How do they emerge in interpersonal and merge conflicts? How do we collaborate and develop teams that develop shared mental models that develop code? How do I do this when I'm working on my own, as much as within a team?

I have political views, and they'll inform what I have to say (even down to choice of words like the name of the blog), but I'll try not to "write about politics." Politics is a group project--even more so than software development. So thinking and writing about politics should be done with people. This blog is an individual project, with the risk of devolving into a random walk. So I'm ready to see where it takes me.
